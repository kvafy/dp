\chapter{CD Content}\label{ch:appendix_cd_content}
Content of the enclosed CD is organized into the following directories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \srccode{1-benchmarks/}: Network \srccode{.net} files, datasets and measurements related to the first practical application.
    \item \srccode{2-crime/}: Vector images of the final three networks that resulted from the analysis of criminality. Also contains the original dataset, its discretized version, networks learnt during the feature elimination process and records of analysis of the crime impact factor.
    \item \srccode{3-spam/}: Datasets (the original dataset, its discretized version, train and test sets for holdout testing and for 5-fold cross-validation). Also contains measurement records and figures.
    \item \srccode{program/}: Program source codes compilable using the \emph{ant} build tool and also runnable compiled version in \srccode{program/bin-precompiled}.
    \item \srccode{text/}:  {\LaTeX} sources of this thesis, including all figures.
\end{itemize} 





\chapter{Crime analysis\,--\,final networks}\label{ch:appendix_crime_net}
This chapter contains the three networks that are result of the crime analysis performed in Section~\ref{ch:practical_crime}. Because of their size, each network is on its own A3 page. If you have trouble reading variable names in the printed version please see the electronic version of this thesis or the original figures on the encolsed CD within the directory \srccode{2-crime/final networks/}.
